                Where did we come from?
                Why are we here?
                Where do we go when we die?
                What lies beyond
                And what lay before?
                Is anything certain in life?

                They say: Life is too short
                The here and the now
                And: You're only given one shot
                But could there be more
                Have I lived before
                Or could this be all that we've got?

                If I die tomorrow
                I'd be all right
                Because I believe
                That after we're gone
                The spirit carries on

                I used to be frightened of dying
                I used to think death was the end
                But that was before
                I'm not scared anymore
                I know that my soul will transcend

                I may never find all the answers
                I may never understand why
                I may never prove
                What I know to be true
                But I know that I still have to try

                If I die tomorrow
                I'd be allright
                Because I believe
                That after we're gone
                The spirit carries on

                [Victoria]
                Move on, be brave
                Don't weep at my grave
                Because I am no longer here
                But please never let
                Your memory of me disappear

                [Nicholas]
                Safe in the light that surrounds me
                Free of the fear and the pain
                My questioning mind
                Has helped me to find
                The meaning in my life again
                Victoria's real
                I finally feel
                At peace with the girl in my dreams
                And now that I'm here
                It's perfectly clear
                I found out what all of this means

                If I die tomorrow
                I'd be allright
                Because I believe

                She just woke up, but she's still tired
                Is that the telephone ringing ?
                The curtains can't hold back the light
                That's reaching into her dreams
                Down in her heart
                If it had fingers, it'll be tearing it apart

                You'll be lookin' groovy
                In a sixties movie
                Maybe tell the press you died
                Little legend baby
                Try your very best to hide
                A green-tinted sixties mind

                She keeps some memories locked away
                But they are always escaping
                Neglect won't make them fade away
                They're reaching into her dreams
                Down in her heart
                Don't need fingers to be tearing it apart

                Gotta face the day
                There is no other way
                To clear the fog inside your mind
                Fill it up with dreams
                But all that she can seem to find
                A green-tinted sixties mind

                Hangin' out with Janis
                Movin' to Atlantis
                Could've made it if you tried
                What's the point of force?
                It's easy as a horse to ride
                A green-tinted sixties mind

                You'll be looking groovy
                In a sixties movie

                Hey you on the brink
                Waiting to fall
                To become human surplus
                The movie's still shooting
                You might still get the roll
                And man it's all just a circus

                But the clown left town long ago
                Maybe he'll come back and give us a show

                CHORUS
                And we all need some light now
                We all need some light now
